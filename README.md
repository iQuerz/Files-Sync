# Files-Sync

## If you wish to use this on your device (which i really don't recommend), please follow the instructions first.

#### 1)
 The form doesn't use async events. That means, when you click on the "push" button and start sending files, except if using a debugger, the app will crash if you try to do anything before it sums up the sending. Maybe I'll update i in the future.
#### 2)
 You *must* create a config.txt file on your android device on a specific location, that is the root of internal storage (/storage/emulated/0/). The .txt file should contain one line, featuring your pc's local ip (192.168.1.10).
#### 3)
 If you want to send protected files, you will need to start the .exe file as an administrator, manually. I did not waste time on adding the feature since I'm making this purely for my own use. Maybe I'll update it in the future.
#### 4)
 The android app is just a "load it up and then close". It *will* run in your background, it had no interface, no looks, 0 design. Its only purpose is receiving the data. The .apk file is in the master's root.
#### 5)
 If using, start the desktop .exe first, after selecting your files and clicking the "push" button, go to your android and start the app. From this point, just wait. The app closes automatically when it's finished receiving.

#### other
At this moment (latest release-22.04.2020), the app is android only.I can make an ios version if I get a request. If you experience any bugs, please, contact me. Although I made this purely for myself and my music library, I would like to see others use it.
